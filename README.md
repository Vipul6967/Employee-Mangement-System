# README: Employee Management System with SQLite Integration

### Description:
This Employee Management System is a Python-based GUI application built with `Tkinter`. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing employee records in an SQLite database. The application also integrates features for data visualization and fetching weather/location information.

### Features:
1. **SQLite Integration**: Employee data is stored in an SQLite database (`eems.db`) with fields for `ID`, `Name`, and `Salary`.  
2. **Add Employee**: Save employee details into the database with validations for ID, Name, and Salary.  
3. **View Employees**: Display all employee records from the database.  
4. **Update Employee**: Update existing employee details (Name and/or Salary) based on ID.  
5. **Delete Employee**: Delete a specific employee record by ID.  
6. **Top 5 Employees Chart**: Visualize the top 5 employees with the highest salaries using `matplotlib`.  
7. **Weather & Location Info**: Fetch and display current city temperature and location using the OpenWeatherMap and IPInfo APIs.
